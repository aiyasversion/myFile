    <h1>Taylor Swift</h1>
    <h2>All Too Well</h2>
 <div class="box">
    <p>Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red <br>You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed<br>And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team<br>You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me<br>And you were tossing me the car keys</p>
    <h5>Fuck the patriarchy</h5>
    <p>Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town</p>
 </div>
 <div class="box1">
    <p>And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes</p>
    <h5>I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age</h5>
    <p>From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones</p>
    <p>I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight</p>
    <p>And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?</p>
    <p>Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?</p>
    <p>'Cause in this city's barren cold</p>
    <p>I still remember the first fall of snow</p>
    <p>And how it glistened as it fell</p>
    <p>I remember it all too well</p>
 </div>
